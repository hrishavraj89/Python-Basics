# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S?
s = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1,2]}

# No, you cannot change the values inside a list that is contained in a set in Python. This is because sets in Python can only contain immutable (hashable) objects, and lists are mutable (non-hashable).
# Therefore, attempting to include a list in a set will result in a TypeError.
